# The So-Called Generic High Entropy Secret

Some third-party tools will scan this Git to find Generic High Entropy Secret.
Content like `AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE3MjU3OTQwNjkwNTU6UDFQaEJINVRRM0NacFFSVDd2cUV1QQ` is generated from a one-time Kibana instance,
and the related Kibana instance has been destroyed.
The entire Git is only used to serve the interpretation of the relevant article.
In fact, there is no Generic High Entropy Secret that needs to be removed.
